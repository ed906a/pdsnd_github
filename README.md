The Python Project for **Udacity Programming for Data Science** was created on Oct. 9, 2019. This README file is updated Oct. 21, 2019 for the *Version Control Project*

### Project Title
**Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### Description
This is a *Python* script project for **Udacity Programming for Data Science** that is used to explore the data related bikeshare systems in Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The data is from imported csv files and the *Python* script/program will calculate the statistics from the csv data from interactive user input.

The *Python* program will answer mostly the following information: Based on the city input of the user:
* The most **popular month** for start time
* The most **popular day** of the Week
* The most **popular hour** of day
* The **total** trip duration and **average** trip duration
* The most popular **start** and **end** station
* The most **popular trip**
* The counts of each **user type**
* The counts of the **gender** *(if available)*
* The earliest , most recent and most popular **birth years**
